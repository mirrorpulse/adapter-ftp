# MirrorPulse FTP and FTPS Adapter

This repository contains the independent FTP and FTPS Worker process for MirrorPulse. Each configured instance runs in its own process and communicates with the Host through a current-user Named Pipe.

## Build

Run `pwsh ./eng/verify.ps1` to restore and build the Worker for Windows x64 and ARM64. The reusable IPC SDK is under `src/MirrorPulse.Adapter.Sdk/`.

## Release status

The Worker implementation is under product integration. No signed production `.mpadapter` release has been published from this repository. Release packages will include both architectures, a verified file inventory, and a detached package signature.
