# MirrorPulse FTP and FTPS Adapter

This repository contains the independent FTP and FTPS Worker process for MirrorPulse. Each configured instance runs in its own process and communicates with the Host through a current-user Named Pipe.

## Build

Run `pwsh ./eng/verify.ps1` to restore and build the Worker for Windows x64 and ARM64. The reusable IPC SDK is under `src/MirrorPulse.Adapter.Sdk/`.

## Release status

The Worker implementation is under product integration. No signed production `.mpadapter` release has been published from this repository. Release packages will include both architectures, a verified file inventory, and a detached package signature.

## Release governance

The release scripts and pinned staged workflow follow the template at commit
544c594. Version/tag inputs enter scripts through environment data and are
validated before paths or builds are created. Build has no signing secrets;
signing uses the `adapter-signing` environment; publishing alone has write
permission and uses `adapter-release`. Manual dispatch defaults to a verified
signed artifact without publishing a tag or Release.

Run `pwsh ./eng/verify-release.ps1` for hostile input rejection and a dual-RID
package signed with a disposable in-memory key. Production keys are read only
from signing-step environment variables. No private key file is read or exported.
The embedded inventory is verified before upload; MirrorPulse independently
verifies publisher trust at installation.

The repository owner must configure environment reviewers, trusted branch/tag
rules and signing-secret scope. YAML environment names alone do not enforce those
protections. Existing organization secrets remain compatible until that migration.
The current framework-dependent v1 runtime is retained by this release change.

The release workflow also verifies the newly signed candidate using MirrorPulse
16c6742 and real Local/WebDAV/SMB/FTP/SFTP Host/Worker fixtures on a disposable
runner. It records both source commits and the candidate package hash. Publishing
requires that protocol gate; signed dry-run assets remain unpublished.
